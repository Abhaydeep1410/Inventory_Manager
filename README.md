# Inventory Management System

## Overview
BiSquare, a small manufacturing organization, required a more efficient inventory system to replace their outdated spreadsheet-based approach. This **JavaFX-based Inventory Management System** provides a robust and user-friendly solution for managing parts and products.

## Features
- **User-Friendly GUI**: Built with JavaFX for a smooth and interactive interface.
- **Inventory Management**: Add, modify, delete, and search for parts and products.
- **Product-Part Association**: Assign parts to products and manage dependencies.
- **Validation & Error Handling**: Ensures data integrity with real-time validation.
- **Custom Business Logic**: Implements BiSquare‚Äôs specific requirements, such as inventory constraints and pricing rules.

## Technologies Used
- **Java 8+** (Core Programming)
- **JavaFX** (GUI Development)
- **FXML** (UI Layout Definition)
- **MVC Architecture** (Separation of Concerns)
- **NetBeans IDE** (Recommended for development)

## System Architecture
The system follows the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architecture:

- **Model**: Manages business logic and data.
- **View**: Defines the UI using JavaFX and FXML.
- **Controller**: Handles user interactions and updates the model.

## Business Logic & Validations
‚úî A product **must have at least one** associated part.  
‚úî Products **cannot be deleted** if parts are assigned.  
‚úî Inventory levels **must be within min/max constraints**.  
‚úî Product price **cannot be lower** than the total cost of its parts.  
‚úî **Confirmation dialogs** for all Delete & Cancel actions.  

## Setup & Installation
